  ## Submarine
  An [OOP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming) practice project that simulates a submarine movement in a three-dimensional space (x, y, z). Also had a bit of a [TDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) practice. [Original idea (Brazilian Portuguese).](https://github.com/flaviomicheletti/submarino-da-buscape)
  - Standard version: Made with basic OOP.
  - Dataclass version: Same project but made with the [dataclass python module.](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html)
  - Web version: Same concept but with a simple front-end form and output at the bottom of the page.
